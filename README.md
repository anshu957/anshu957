💬 About me

    🚀 Trained as a Robotics and Automation Engineer, ventured into the corporate world with SAP Business Analytics, and now passionately pursuing 
       scientific problems, diving deep into Physics, Dynamical Systems, and Machine Learning, all while unlocking their powerful applications in Mammalian 
       Genomics!
  
    📊🌐 My experience spans modeling dynamical systems (ODEs, SDEs) on graphs (complex network topologies) for Physics & Ecology, exploring emergence of   
        spatio-temporal patterns 🌍
        
    🧠💡 Expertise in Unsupervised ML (cluster analysis, PCA, UMAP, t-SNE) and Supervised ML (linear regression, classification) for data analysis & 
        visualization.

🧬🔍 My current project:

      Using RNA velocity obtained from scRNA-seq to identify cell states & fate by tapping into the world of attractors & basins in dynamical systems. A 
      nuanced view of cell state transitions & drivers of cell fate decisions is on the horizon!



💻🔧 Technical toolkit: 

    HPC, Docker, Git, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Python(pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib), Julia, C/C++ and always eager to learn more!


🌱 I’m currently learning:

    🎓 Semi-definite Programming: Diving into the world of convex optimization and mathematical programming to solve complex problems with precision!
    
    🧬 Single Cell Biology: Unraveling the secrets of cellular diversity, function, and behavior at the individual cell level for a deeper understanding of 
     biology!
     
     🕸️ Graph Neural Networks: Exploring the power of GNNs to analyze and model intricate data on graphs. 

🔗🔬 Let's forge connections, collaborate, and contribute meaningfully to the realm of data-driven scientific research!
