🚀 Trained as a Robotics and Automation Engineer, followed by a corporate stint with SAP Business Analytics, 
and now pursuing scientific research at the interface of Physics, Dynamical Systems, Machine Learning and Genomics. 

    📊🌐 Experience in modeling dynamical systems (ODEs, SDEs) on graphs (complex network topologies) 
        for Physics & Ecology, exploring emergence of spatio-temporal patterns 🌍
        
    🧠💡 Expertise in Unsupervised ML (clustering, PCA, UMAP, t-SNE) and 
        Supervised ML (linear regression, classification), physics informed neural networks.

🧬🔍 My current project:

      Using RNA velocity obtained from scRNA-seq to identify cell states & fate by 
      tapping into the world of attractors & basins in dynamical systems. A nuanced view 
      of cell state transitions & drivers of cell fate decisions is on the horizon!


💻🔧 Technical toolkit: 

    HPC, Docker, Git, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Python(pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib), 
    Julia, C/C++. 
     

🔗🔬 Here to forge connections, collaborate, and contribute towards reproducible data-driven scientific research!
